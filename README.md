# Energy-Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast short-term electricity demand fluctuations in the UK by analyzing interconnector flow data, enhancing grid management and operational efficiency. This project is focused on the following three objectives:

i.  Quantify the Correlation between Interconnector Flows and Electricity Demand Patterns
ii.  Develop and Validate Predictive Models for Forecasting Short-Term Electricity Demand Based on Historical Interconnector Activities
iii.  Assess the Impact of Interconnector Activities on Electricity Demand During Critical Periods Using Multiple Linear Regression

This  presents an overview  of  the   methodology  used  to  investigate  the  effect  of interconnector activities on short-term electricity demand fluctuations in the United Kingdom. It details  the  data  sources,  analytical  techniques,  and modeling  approaches  employed, including exploratory data analysis, time-series forecasting, and regression analysis. Interconnectors play a crucial   role   in   improving   grid   dependability,   integrating   renewable  energy   sources,  and mitigating  changes  in  electricity  demand  by  enabling  the  interchange  of  electricity  across borders.
